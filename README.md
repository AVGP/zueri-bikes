# Züri Bikes

## Warning: Work in progress!
This is a working prototype that will eventually evolve in something that's usable.

## What's this?
This will be a handy little helper to find the nearest "Züri rollt" bike sharing station and the number of bikes available.

Luckily Zürich makes this data available publicly and in real time (seriously, how cool is THAT?) so this is very, very helpful.
